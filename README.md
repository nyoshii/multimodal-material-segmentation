## Download data
The Multimodal Material Segmentation dataset (MCubeS dataset) is available in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14egTCyC0Pampb7imrXVwaDRffHN7FZxh/view?usp=sharing) (`multimodal_dataset.zip`, 9.27GB). Uncompress the folder and move it to `/dataset/multimodal_dataset/`

The data should organized in the following format:
```

* polL_dolp: dolp data of each image set (represented as .npy file).
* polL_color: RGB image of each image set.
* polL_aolp_sin (cos): the sin (cos) value of aolp data of each image set (both represented as .npy file).
* list_folder: all.txt records the name of all image sets. Train/val/test.txt records the name of image sets assigned to train/val/test set. 
* SS: semantic annotation of each image set. The semantic labels here are the same as Cityscapes. 
* SSGT4MS: condensed semantic segmentation annotation of each image set. As depicted in Supplemental Material Section C, the 23 semantic classes of Cityscapes are consolidated into 10 classes. 
* NIR_warped_mask: mask of illegal region of each images set. Pixels in the white area will be excluded when computing the loss. 
* NIR_warped: NIR image of each image set.
* GT: material annotation of each image set. 
## Details of MCubeS dataset
### Overview
MCubeS captures the visual appearance of various materials found in daily outdoor scenes from a viewpoint on a road, pavement, or sidewalk. At each viewpoint, we capture images with three fundamentally different imaging modalities, RGB, polarization (represented as Aolp and Dolp), and near-infrared (NIR). There are 500 images sets in MCubeS dataset, and each pixel in RGB image is labeled as one of 13 material classes.

### Material labels
We define 20 distinct materials by thoroughly examining the data we captured in the MCubeS dataset. Examples of all materials are shown below.

Here are some annotation examples.

### Statistics
The pixel numbers of each material class in train, val and test set are shown below.

## Usage
### Prerequisites

We tested our code with Python 3.6.12 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.  Our code depends on the following modules.
* torch==1.7.1
* matplotlib==3.3.2
* numpy==1.19.2
* opencv_python==4.4.0.44

To install this package with pip, use the following command:
```
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
in your (virtual) environment.
### Prepare of the semantic segmentation guidance
Train a semantic segmentation network model by images in `/dataset/multimodal_dataset/polL_color/` and `/dataset/multimodal_dataset/SSGT4MS/`. Put the semantic segmentation result images in `/dataset/multimodal_dataset/SSmask/`.
### Training and testing
* To train MCubeSNet, simply run 
```
$ sh main_train_multimodal.sh
```
* To test MCubeSNet, simply run 
```
$ sh main_test_multimodal.sh
```
